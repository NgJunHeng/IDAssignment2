Daily Expenses Tracker(Project name)

My project consist of 2 pages. The first page consist the information and purpose of the website i am making. The 2nd website is the product itself.
The website can allow user to enter their Income and also their Expenses and then help them come out with the budget for the month. This website lets user
know their monthly budget as they key in the neccessary information on their expenses. When adding a description, there is a dropdown box which includes the
letter 'i' and 'e' . 'i' representing Income and 'e' representing expenses. User can add a description for example Salary or others. The tick beside the 
description box is to enter the whole data. The chart used in tracker.html is just a display. It wont be updated if data is entered. The chart is created
using google chart API. 

Design Process

This website is for people who want to know what is thier monthly budget.What i want to achieve is to let users enter their data and let them get the results
that they wanted. I created a simple website that lets user enter their monthly income and also the expenses for the month. I got the home page which tell 
users more about how to use the websites. Then after clicking a button in the home page, they can then use the Budget Tracker to track their budget for the
month. The data will then show below the place where they input data. This is let user see what they have spend on their expenses and how much they have left
for the rest of the month. At the bottom of the tracker page, there is a chart shown. It wont show the data user enter because i did not know how to use it
with the chart. Instead it shows user how they can track their expenses by using a chart.
